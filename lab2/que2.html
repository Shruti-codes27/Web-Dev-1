            BTS also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. 
            The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook, who co-write 
            or co-produce much of their material. Originally a hip hop group, they expanded 
            their musical style to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyrics have 
            focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and 
            coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences 
            of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced literature,
            philosophy and psychology, and includes an alternate universe storyline.
